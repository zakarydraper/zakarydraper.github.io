## The Study: Deception Detection {#chisq-study}

### Study Information

#### Description

Laboratory studies have consistently shown that people make terrible lie detectors. It seems that liars in these settings do not provide reliable, observable indicators of their deception. But this could in part be due to the necessarily low stakes of lying in experimental studies. High-stakes lies, such as are common in criminal justice contexts, may elicit involuntary cues from liars that are impossible to replicate in an ethical laboratory study.

This is supported by research. Ecologically valid studies of high-stakes lies have found that there are reliable behavioural cues to deception. For example, @tenbrinke2012 examined videos of people pleading for the safe return of missing relatives. In some of those cases, the pleader was later revealed to have murdered the missing person. In this high-stakes scenario, dishonest murderers showed signs of emotional leakage, which could be used to reliably predict their dishonesty.

Emotional leakage is present in lies told by dishonest pleaders, but how well can humans use this information to detect deception? The current study will address this question using minimally trained observers.

#### Hypothesis

It is hypothesized that with minimal training, participants will demonstrate greater than chance accuracy in identifying deceptive pleaders.

### Design Plan

#### Study Design

Participants will complete this study online. After providing informed consent, they will be directed to a 10-minute video giving them a brief introduction into how to identify emotional leakage. After this training, they will answer questions meant to assess how well they comprehended the instruction provided in the training. They will then watch a video of a pleader who is either truthful or dishonest. Finally, they will be asked to decide whether they think the pleader is truthful or dishonest.

#### Instruments and Measures

*Training Video.* The training video will be short (10 minutes) and introduce participants to the basic ideas of emotional leakage. It will give examples of emotional leakage from pleader videos. It will also give examples of genuine pleaders.

*Comprehension Questions.* These will be four multiple-choice questions pertaining directly to the content of the training.

*Pleader Videos.* Consistent with prior research in this domain, this study will use archival footage of individuals pleading for the return of their missing relatives. Pleaders coded as dishonest will be those against whom there is overwhelming evidence in support of the pleader having murdered the missing person. Conversely, those coded as truthful will only be those in which the abundance of evidence makes clear that the pleader is not responsible. Cases for which the innocence of the pleader is unclear will not be used.

#### Analytic Strategy

A &chi;<sup>2</sup> test of independence will be conducted to determine whether the proportion of correct identifications is significantly greater than would be expected due to chance alone. Given the high stakes of making an error in this setting, the traditional &alpha; = .05 seems too liberal. We opted for a more conservative &alpha; = .01 for determining significance.
