How is screen time affecting your family?

I am working working with non-profit organizations [Project Literacy Kelowna](http://projectliteracykelowna.org/), [Childhood Connections](https://childhoodconnections.ca/), and the [Central Okanagan Early Years Partnership](https://coeyp.ca/) to examine the influence of technology use and screen time on families with young children in the Okanagan Valley. We are currently recruiting participants for this study. Learn more—and sign up to participate—at our study [website](https://familyscreentime.ca).
