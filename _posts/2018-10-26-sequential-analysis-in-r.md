LagSequential is an R package for analysing lag-sequential categorical data. Information about the package can be found in the package [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LagSequential/LagSequential.pdf). LagSequential is available through the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LagSequential/index.html) and can be installed by running the code below.

```
install.packages("LagSequential")
library(LagSequential)
```

I worked with Brian O'Connor to write this package based on his programs for conducting the same analyses in SPSS, SAS, and Fortran 77, which are available at his [website](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/brioconn/).

For more information about sequential analysis, see the package [documentation](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/LagSequential/LagSequential.pdf) or any of the references below.
