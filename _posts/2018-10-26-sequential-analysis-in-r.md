Sequential analysis refers to the examination of the influence of an observation on the observation that follows it. For example, researchers may be interested in whether a certain behaviour in one individual is more likely to occur in response to another behaviour. Such questions can be tested statistically using one of several methods described by Wampold and Margolin (1982).

Functions for running these analyses in R are provided here. These R programs are based on programs written by Brian O'Connor for SPSS, SAS, and Fortran 77, which are available at his [website](https://people.ok.ubc.ca/brioconn/).
