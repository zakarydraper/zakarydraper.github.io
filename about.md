# About

I am a Master of Arts in Psychological Science student researching quantitative methods at the University of British Columbiaâ€”Okanagan (UBCO). As a quantitative researcher, my focus is on statistical techniques and the ways researchers draw conclusions from data. My current work focuses on methods for determining the number of latent variables to retain from a principal components analysis or principal axis factoring solution. I am investigating the use of supervised learning as a means of integrating multiple previously developed retention methods into a single retention method that can be applied to datasets with a variety of characteristics.

I am passionate about the appropriate use of statistics to answer research questions. As such, I am happy to share the knowledge and skills that I have developed with my peers and other researchers. I regularly collaborate on research projects and offer advice on how to best collect and analyze data to draw conclusions.
