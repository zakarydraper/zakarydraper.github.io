# About

I am a Master of Arts in Psychological Science student, researching quantitative methods at The University of British Columbia—Okanagan (UBCO). As a quantitative researcher, my focus is on the statistical techniques researchers use to draw conclusions from datasets. I hope my research will provide novel approaches to data analysis that researchers can use to confidently answer research questions.

My current work focuses on methods for determining the number of latent variables to retain from a principal components analysis (PCA) or principal axis factoring (PAF) solution. It is essential to the validity of these techniques that the researcher not ignore important dimensions or retain trivial ones. I am investigating the use of supervised learning as a means of integrating multiple previously developed retention methods into a single retention method that can be applied to datasets with a variety of characteristics.

Outside of quantitative research, I regularly collaborate on research projects in other disciplines. These projects include investigations of topics such as the impact of digital device screen time on the well-being of families with young children, the use of canine–assisted therapy to law enforcement personnel well-being, and song lyrics as predictors of cannabis use in adolescents.

I have experience working in R, Python, SQL, and Microsoft Excel.
