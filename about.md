# About

I am a PhD student in Psychological Science studying quantitative methods at The University of British Columbiaâ€”Okanagan. As a quantitative researcher, my focus is on the statistical techniques researchers use to draw conclusions from datasets. I hope my research will provide novel approaches to data analysis that researchers can use to confidently answer research questions.

My substantive research focuses on understanding how smartphones may be harming (and helping!) social connectedness. I also regularly collaborate with researchers in other areas.

I have experience working in R, Python, SQL, and Microsoft Excel.

I am also a [musician][1] and [3D artist][2].
