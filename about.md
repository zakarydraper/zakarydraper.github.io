# About

I am a Master of Arts in Psychological Science student, researching quantitative methods at The University of British Columbia—Okanagan. As a quantitative researcher, my focus is on the statistical techniques researchers use to draw conclusions from datasets. I hope my research will provide novel approaches to data analysis that researchers can use to confidently answer research questions.

Outside of quantitative research, I regularly collaborate on research projects in other disciplines. These projects include investigations of topics such as the impact of digital device screen time on the well-being of families with young children, the use of canine–assisted therapy to improve law enforcement personnel well-being, and song lyrics as predictors of cannabis use in adolescents.

I have experience working in R, Python, SQL, and Microsoft Excel.

I am also a [musician][1] and [3D artist][2].
